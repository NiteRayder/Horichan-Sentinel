# Contributing to Horichan Sentinel

## Development

- Use Node.js 22.12+.
- Keep OAuth credentials, session secrets, bot tokens, and API tokens out of Git.
- Keep privileged API calls on the server.
- Every guild-management endpoint must verify the signed-in user's current permissions and Horichan's presence/access to the guild.
- Keep UI states honest: do not show a feature as working until its backend is implemented and tested.
